## Built-in Laravel Boilerplate Module Generator
It gives you the ability to create a module using a sweet GUI, where you put in the Module Name and it will generate all the necessary files for you, like Model, Traits, Relationship, Migration, Controllers, Views and routes. So when you are done creating a module, you can directly go to the route generated and see your new module. Since, this does not have the ability to generate table fields for now, so you have to write the migration file that is generated and run a manual php artisan migrate command, and you are good to go.
